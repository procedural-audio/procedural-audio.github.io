## Signal Flow Basics

Start by combining simple oscillators and filters. The Lab workspace lets you drag new nodes into
the canvas and connect them with patch cables. Colour-coded ports make it easy to distinguish audio
from control signals.

## Suggested Exercises

- Build a two-oscillator patch with cross modulation.
- Use envelopes to shape amplitude and filter cutoff over time.
- Export your patch to audition inside the compiler.
