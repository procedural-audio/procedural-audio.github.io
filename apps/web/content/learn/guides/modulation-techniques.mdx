## Dynamic Modulation

Introduce movement with LFOs, random sources, and sequencers. Remember to keep modulation depth in
checkâ€”subtle changes often read better than extreme swings.

## Routing Ideas

- Modulate delay time for evolving textures.
- Drive wave-shapers with stepped control signals.
- Layer multiple modulation sources to avoid repetition.
