## Snapshot Rendering

Use the headless renderer to export short audio clips as part of CI. Compare waveform hashes to
detect regressions in your DSP graphs.

## Integration Tips

- Cache render outputs to keep pipelines fast.
- Run loudness analysis to verify gain staging.
- Combine with visual diffing when patches produce spectrograms or parameter logs.
