## Installation

Install the Procedure SDK through pnpm or your preferred package manager. The SDK ships with types,
CLI helpers, and sample pipelines for rapid prototyping.

```bash
pnpm add @procedure/sdk
```

## Configuration

Create a `.procedurerc.json` file at the root of your project to define asset directories and build
targets. Run `procedure init` to scaffold recommended defaults.
